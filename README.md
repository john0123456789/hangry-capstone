# Challenges
* Some challenges I ran into was definitely styling. Getting the star rating to look and work similarly to how Yelp had it proved to be more challenging than I thought. 
* Referencing the wireframes and trying to get it to look even somewhat close was the most difficult part for me.

# Future Features
* Search Bar
* Images for Businesses and Users
* User Profile Pages
* Map
